# Docker in Detroit Workshop

## Welcome

Hello! Thank you for investing your time today to learn more about how the Docker Enterprise Platform is helping customers transform their applications through Docker containers, including simplifying migrations to Microsoft Azure. 

## Agenda

Today we will begin with an overview of Docker Enterprise, including a discussion around use cases and commonly seen scenarios. We will then transition to a hands-on period with a series of exercises. 

| Approximate Timing | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 09:00 - 10:30 | Presentation: Overview of the Docker Enterprise Platform | 
| 10:30 - 12:00 | Lab 01: Provisioning the Docker Enterprise Platform in Azure <br /><br />This lab uses the Docker Certified Infrastructure (DCI) project to first provision and then configure all necessary Azure resources for a highly-available Docker Enterprise environment. |
| 12:00 - 01:30 | Lab 02: Containerizing a .NET Application <br /><br />This hands-on lab shows you how to take an existing ASP.NET WebForms app, run it in Docker and then modernize the app by breaking features out and running them in separate containers. |
| 01:30 - 03:00 | Lab 03: Deploying Multi-OS applications with Docker Enterprise <br /><br /> In this lab we will use a Docker Enterprise cluster to deploy both a Java web app on Linux and a multi-service application that includes both Windows and Linux components using Docker Swarm. Then we'll take a look at securing and scaling the application. Finally, we will then deploy the same app using Kubernetes. |
